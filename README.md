1. Porting 110 Course Modules to SCORM (LMS Interface)
2. Replacing WordPress pages with static pages outside the paywall
3. Simplify Database queries in ASP pages (login and course pages mostly)
4. Remove tables that do not add functionality (ex. tblCompany_Course)
5. Pull out simplified Database queries as an API that can be used by a mobile app (Like going to the Index instead of the Table of Contents)
